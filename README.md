# imperva_test_igor_sakhno

Just a testing project:

Now, I would like you to write a function that receives a date and a number of days to add. 
The function will need to calculate the new date taking into consideration the calendar. 
Example 1: Input: Date: 10.01.2008, number_of_days: 10 output: 20.01.2008 
Example 2: Input: Date: 29.06.2020, number_of_days: 8 output: 07.07.2020 
* Please, use Python to solve this task 
** You can use datetime module if you want to ease date parsing, but donâ€™t use it for calculation algorithm 
*** Please, upload solution to GitHub - just create public repo and send us the link when solution would be ready
